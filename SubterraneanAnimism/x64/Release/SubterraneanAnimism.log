C:\Users\spark\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Projects\SubterraneanAnimism\SubterraneanAnimism\Renderer.cpp(26,10): warning C4858: discarding return value: The result of 'std::async' should be stored in a variable. If the return value is discarded, the temporary 'std::future' is destroyed, waiting for an async result or evaluating a deferred result, thus defeating the purpose of 'std::async'.
